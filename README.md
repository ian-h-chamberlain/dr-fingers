# Dr. Fingers

A game made by @ian-h-chamberlain for the [Rusty Jam #2](https://itch.io/jam/rusty-jam-2).

You play as the poor victim(s) of the mad scientist Dr. Fingers' horrific
experimentation. He has captured innocent animals and created new chimera-like
combinations of them. They may be stuck like this, but now they're taking back
their freedom and escaping from his lab! Use the animals' special talents to fight
evil robots and escape from the Doctor's booby-trapped lair.

## Dev Tasks

- [ ] basic side-scroller movement (jump, platforms, camera)
- [ ] build a basic level
- [ ] special abilities (double-jump / glide)
  - [ ] add traps/obstacles for these to be used in
- [ ] combat / enemies. Maybe a stretch goal
- [ ] 2nd character / char swapping
